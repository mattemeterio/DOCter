Opening code and data is more than uploading code to GitHub repositories. Developing a culture of “open first,” we can engender trust by transparency in government. The internal commitment to "open first" is a good faith effort on the part of DC to both the community of residents we serve and the open source community online.

Furthermore, by supporting a community around contributions to open source projects by calls to action, [hackathons](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/11/hacking-a-universes-worth-of-data/382543/), and interacting with the existing civically-engaged open source community in DC, we can identify ways to improve efficiency in local government by technology at effectively zero cost.
