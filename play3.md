title:  "Play 3 - Sharing code internally and externally"

From OCTO, the Master Address Repository is useful in a number of ways to many different agencies. When the MAR is open sourced, it removes some of the hurdles to building tools for agencies, like a ‘quick fix’ tool for residents to alert DCRA about a vacant building, or economic indicators about building occupancy for DMPED. Things like APIs - tools for interested parties to programmatically access data, rather than combing through spreadsheets - are invaluable as a building block for other projects.

When these agencies interact, they require a common language, so identifying standard conventions to be used in your projects will be a key component. Much like writing for people, there are style conventions around commenting the code, naming the projects and components, and things like whitespace, all of which can improve or degrade readability and understanding.

As your open source projects mature, they may be "forked" - that is, copied by another person or organization, internal or external to DC government, and modified. They may make substantial changes to the code of their fork creating something entirely new on your project's base, or make minor branding changes to a project that they can use "out of the box." Independent of the scope of the changes they make, your project is identified as the root - and you can similarly fork other projects if they are valuable or contribute in some way to improving a project your agency is working on. In either case, the origin project can roll some of the modifications back in through a "pull request", improving both projects.
