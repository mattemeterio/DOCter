title:  "Play 2 - Opening datasets"
---
There are unique challenges to opening datasets rather than code. The major concern, even for anonymized data, is the mosaic effect, where multiple points of data can be linked back to a single individual. Special care should be taken in releasing datasets to not provide so much data attached to a single responses to be used for reidentification purposes.

The process of choosing a license is a bit different from choosing one when open sourcing code, as well. Public datasets are well served by the [Creative Commons "CC0" license](=https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/CC0_use_for_data), for public domain, as identified by the White House in the [US Open Data Action Plan](=https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/us_open_data_action_plan.pdf), among others.
