By identifying feasibility and value of releasing codebases for different projects, and ensuring that public code doesn't create security or privacy issues. There are a multitude of related issues here, and some of them are expanded on in the whitepapers at [link.]

Once the risks around security and privacy concerns are managed, the question becomes when to open source the project. Drawing from best practices in the open source community, "the expectation is that those that produce the software would release the underlying code early and often in its raw form. Bugs and unpolished work are not only accepted, it's the norm."

Our preferred tool is GitHub, and [someone can train you on using it?]. Open a repository under the [DCGov organization](https://github.com/dcgov), and start uploading.

It doesn’t have to be a perfectly crafted tool, and in some ways, it’s more effective as a learning process if it isn’t. The key component to open source is the collaborative process.
