Code written by government agencies falls under public domain, however, code written for government agencies, by contractors or vendors, is much more legally gray, often defaulting to whatever party has the physical storage where the code is located. For both transparency and ease of transitioning to open source, there should be standardized language to ensure that when a third party provides a product to an agency, the source code is delivered with it.

Internally, identifying an open source licensing framework should be an important step. The license chosen will determine how your project can be reused or otherwise modified and what restrictions will be placed on those uses, and can protect the original authors from indemnity for problems with the original code and any derivatives. There are many licenses to choose from, and common ones include the [GNU General Public License (GPL)](http://opensource.org/licenses/GPL-3.0), and the [MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
