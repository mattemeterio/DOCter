title:  "Play 1: Understand why you’d want to open source code"
---

Software that is closed, or proprietary, is analogous to the Coca-Cola secret formula or Google's search algorithm. At Google, there’s some competitive advantage gained by not sharing the source code to their search algorithm, and similarly, Microsoft sees value in keeping the source code to Office closed. An alternative to proprietary code is "open source" - code is made open to read by anyone, and available for testing, reuse, and modification. In the public sector, there isn’t a similar model for competition like Coke, Google, and Microsoft face; if the Arts and Humanities Commission writes and open sources a tool for locating arts programming for DC residents, and OCTO adopts the platform for helping people find technology skills training, that’s a good thing for the agencies by making them more efficient, and for the residents of DC. 

Furthermore, if the Boston Arts Commission applies the DC project to their city and in doing so fixes a few bugs, or adds a feature that can be reintegrated into the DC project, both projects - and cities - are better off for their collaboration.
